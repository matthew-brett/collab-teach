# Cross-discipline teaching in data analysis

## Abstract

Over the last few years there has been a radical shift in the teaching of data
analysis, from traditional statistics courses, to methods associated with
"data science".   Data science is a movement that emphasizes the importance of
computation and algorithms in the analysis of all types of data.   This type
of teaching brings with it several large benefits for collaborative learning.
It makes data analysis accessible to students that have minimal interest or
training in mathematics, by replacing mathematical methods with simple
algorithms, that exploit the power of modern computers, and are much easier to
teach and learn.   These algorithms lend themselves to many kinds of data,
making it possible to teach with data across many disciplines.  As an example,
the current "Foundations of Data Science" undergraduate course in Berkeley
takes students from all disciplines, with no requirements for computing or
mathematics, and teaches using data including novels in plain text from
Project Gutenburg, gender differences in US census data, blood test measures
in patients with kidney disease, and house prices in Iowa.  I will demonstrate
the technology that makes this kind of teaching practical, and show how it can
be used for analysis of data sets from diverse academic fields.  I will show
how these methods can be used to teach deep understanding of statistical
inference using little or no mathematics.
