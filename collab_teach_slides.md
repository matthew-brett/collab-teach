# Really though?

# What is it?

*   Radical change in culture of data analysis.
*   Code as foundation;
*   Analysis becomes:
    *    versatile (big, messy, mixed, complex);
    *    realistic about the work of analysis (cleaning, exploring ...);
    *    collaborative;
    *    reproducible;
*   Emphasis on algorithms over mathematics for analysis and explanation.

# Reproducible

> Computing results are now being presented in a very loose, “breezy” way—in
> journal articles, in conferences, and in books. All too often one simply
> takes computations at face value. This is spectacularly against the evidence
> of my own experience. I would much rather that at talks and in referee
> reports, the possibility of such error were seriously examined.

# Realistic

> Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often
> vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made
> precise.  J. W. Tukey (1962) "The future of data analysis".

# Resampling for statistical explanation

Trials of teaching method in high school students [-@simon1969new] and
undergraduates [-@simon1976probability] including those with "low skills and
little interest in mathematics".

# Why did this happen now?

*   Industry has to get the answer right.
*   Demands of data drove the
*   Development of tools -
    [Python](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python),
    [R](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r), machine
    learning.

# Introducing the Berkeley course

* [http://data8.org](http://data8.org/)
* "The course is designed for entry-level students from any major. It is
  designed specifically for students who have not previously taken statistics
  or computer science courses."
  [(link)](https://data.berkeley.edu/education/courses/data-8-foundations-data-science).
* Fastest growing program in the University’s history, with 2000 students
  projected to enroll for 2017-18.
* Textbook is [Inferential and computational thinking](https://www.inferentialthinking.com).
* Source for textbook [on Github](https://github.com/data-8/textbook).

# A short course on statistics with almost no mathematics

* [permutation
  test](https://github.com/matthew-brett/psy-data-sci/permutation_test.ipynb);

# A prediction

* in 10 years, all traditional "statistics" courses will be data science
  courses;
* all undergraduates will take these courses, to teach quantitative methods
  across fields;
* we will have much more cross-discipline teaching, because of shared courses
  and shared tools.
* our students will be more thoughtful and effective as academics and
  citizens.

# Is this the end?

Yes, it's the end of the talk.
